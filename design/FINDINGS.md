# Findings

**Opened 6 August 2026. Open file, added to as verification continues.**

Twelve documents were deleted because they mixed codebase facts with measurements against designs
that no longer exist. Restoring them whole would have brought the stale half back. These are the
findings extracted instead.

**Every line here was verified against live code or the live catalog on the date given, not against
any design and not against the ledger it came from.** The ledger's own "fixed" and "open" markers
were treated as claims to check, never as evidence. That mattered in both directions, and the
section at the foot records the four it killed.

**Scoping rule applied.** A finding is here only if it names a specific file, column, route or
constraint, asserts something checkable against live code or the catalog today, and is not already
recorded in `docs/STATE-OF-PLAY.md` or one of the five recovered documents.

## 1. `requireSuperAdminRow` does not require a row

**`src/lib/admin-access.ts`.** The function computes
`adminUser?.role === 'super_admin' || isSuperAdminPhone(sessionPhone)`.

The name promises a database-backed check. It falls back to `SUPER_ADMIN_PHONES`, **the same
environment variable the first gate already reads**. Every route that calls it believing it has
added an independent, catalog-verifiable second gate has added nothing. The name is the dangerous
part, because it invites exactly that belief.

`STATE-OF-PLAY` records the first half of this, that the phone path mints a CEO with no database row
and no forensic trail. It does not record that the second gate is not a second gate.

Live catalog: `admin_users` holds **1** `super_admin` row. Anyone else holding that authority holds
it entirely off-catalog.

## 2. Every centre is capped at two team members and told it is on Starter

**`src/app/api/invite-user/route.ts:67`.** The query selects `plan, max_teachers` from `centers`.
**`centers.max_teachers` does not exist** (catalog: 0). The error is **not destructured**:

```ts
const { data: centerPlanRow } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('centers')
  .select('plan, max_teachers')
```

So PostgREST returns 42703, `centerPlanRow` is null, and `maxTeam = Number(undefined ?? 2)` is
**2**. Every centre on every plan is capped at two team members. `planName` reads from the same null
object and falls back to `'Starter'`, so a Business centre is told it has reached the limit *for the
Starter plan*.

**A paid feature that silently does not deliver, and fails without an error because the error is
never read.**

## 3. `/api/settings/limits` returns 404 for every centre, always

**`src/app/api/settings/limits/route.ts:18`** selects `max_teachers, max_students, plan`. Neither
`centers.max_teachers` nor `centers.max_students` exists (catalog: 0 and 0). The select errors,
`centerError` is truthy, and the route returns 404 "Center not found" before it counts anything. The
endpoint cannot succeed under any conditions.

## 4. Every vendor print PDF for every card order is dead

**`src/app/api/admin/card-orders/[orderId]/pdf/route.ts:33`** selects `card_style`.
**`card_orders.card_style` does not exist** (catalog: 0). The select errors and the route returns
404 unconditionally.

This one cannot be fixed by deleting the read. **The checkout path writes `card_style`**
(`api/card-order-cart/checkout/route.ts`) and five sites read it. A whole feature was built against
a column that was never added, so removing the reads means deciding the card style option does not
exist. Card orders are parked, which lowers the urgency but not the fact.

## 5. `bosta_shipments` is queried and does not exist

**`src/lib/loadCardOrderDetail.ts:72`** runs
`admin.from('bosta_shipments').select('*').eq('card_order_id', id).maybeSingle()`.
**The table does not exist** (catalog: 0).

## 6. The centre all-in rate is computed five ways and three of them are wrong

`getQuarterlyAllInMonthlyRateFromCenter` (`src/lib/pricing.ts:235`) is the canonical helper and it
resolves `top_centers` then `early_adopter_price` then `all_in_price`. **It has exactly one external
caller**, `src/app/api/admin/billing/route.ts:105`.

Three paths bypass it and never consult `early_adopter_price`:

| Path | Reads |
|---|---|
| `src/app/[locale]/settings/billing/page.tsx:89-93` | `all_in_price` |
| `src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/billing/BillingPageClient.tsx:298-301` | `billing_amount` then `all_in_price` |
| `src/app/api/ceo/dashboard/route.ts:114-115` | `all_in_price` first, though it selects `early_adopter_price` at `:37` and `:108` |

The moment a centre is made an early adopter, `all_in_price` still holds the list price written at
signup while `early_adopter_price` holds what is actually owed. **The owner is shown a renewal figure
above what they pay, on both of their billing screens, while admin MRR shows the correct lower one.**

**Latent today, not visible.** Live catalog: 2 centres, both `is_test`, 0 early adopters, 0 rows with
an `early_adopter_price`. This becomes real on the first early adopter.

---

## 7. The early-adopter badge contradicts the number beside it

**`src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/billing/BillingPageClient.tsx:344`** renders the "Early adopter" chip
from `center.is_early_adopter`, directly beside `displayAmount` computed at `:298-301`, which never
consults the early-adopter price. **The badge and the number disagree by construction**, not by
timing or by data.

*Source: `SURVEY-Center-Money.md`. Verified 6 August 2026.*

---

## 8. `center_invites.status` does not exist

Catalog: 0. Any invite flow that filters or transitions on invite status has nothing to read or
write.

*Source: `BUILD-AFTER-REDESIGN.md` F19. Verified 6 August 2026.*

---

## 9. `subjects.is_active` does not exist, and neither does any grades table

Catalog: `public.subjects` carries no `is_active` column, and no grades table exists in `public`. Any
subject on/off control and the entire grades concept have no backing schema.

*Source: `BUILD-AFTER-REDESIGN.md` F33. Verified 6 August 2026.*

---

## 10. `student_groups.teacher_split_pct` and `assign_teacher_to_group` are dead

The column exists in the catalog and has **zero** references anywhere in `src/`. The RPC
`assign_teacher_to_group` likewise has **zero** references. Dead schema carrying an implied teacher
revenue split that nothing computes.

*Source: `BUILD-AFTER-REDESIGN.md` F9. Verified 6 August 2026.*

---

## 11. `student_groups.capacity_cap` is dead

The column exists in the catalog and has **zero** references anywhere in `src/`.

*Source: `BUILD-AFTER-REDESIGN.md` F11. Verified 6 August 2026.*

# Four the ledger called open and verification closed

**Recorded so nobody re-opens them from an old copy of a deleted document.** Each was carried as an
open finding and each is resolved.

| Was | Now |
|---|---|
| **F44** — `centers.address` has no column, needs a migration, stopped rather than written | **The column exists.** Catalog: 1. Dead finding. |
| **F13** — `students.grade_level` has zero writers, the display will stay blank | **It has a writer.** `src/components/teachers/GroupProposalsTab.tsx:201`. Dead finding. |
| **F5** — `admin_users.custom_permissions` is dead and pending a drop | **Seven files use it**, including a live write at `admin/internal-team/page.tsx:153`. Do not drop it. |
| **F26 item 4** — `card_order_status_transitions.created_at` is read and does not exist | **Genuinely fixed.** `loadCardOrderDetail.ts:67` and `cardOrderState.ts:218` both order by `transitioned_at`, and that column exists. |

This is the same rule that found three of the seven payout defects already fixed. It cuts both ways,
which is the point: a ledger marker is a claim, not evidence, whichever direction it points.

# Still to verify

Not yet checked, and therefore not yet claimed either way.

**15 F-codes:** F5b, F6, F8, F12, F14, F16, F20, F27, F28, F29, F32, F36, F37, F38, F39.
**F16 is next and is the largest expected yield** — "one session, six places where one number had two
sources", the same shape as finding 6.

**7 standing D-codes** from `ASSUMPTIONS-LOG.md`, decisions taken in Eyad's place that are still
live and still relevant: D8, D17, D21, D26, D27, D29, D34. Each goes in as an open decision once its
underlying codebase fact is verified.

**`DATA-GAPS.md`, 79 rows, triaged last.** It is a column-existence sweep and most likely duplicates
findings 2 through 5 and 8 through 11, but that will be checked rather than assumed.
